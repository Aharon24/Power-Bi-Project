This project presents a visual analysis based on survey data collected from software developers. The main focus is on questions related to salary levels, the most commonly used programming languages, and a few additional characteristics of the respondents.

The report was built using Power BI with an Excel file (`Data.xlsx`) as the data source.

## Project Goals

- Identify the most commonly used programming languages among developers
- Analyze the relationship between programming languages and salary levels
- Present the findings in a clear, interactive format

## Data Source

- **Data.xlsx** — contains survey responses from developers, including salary, technologies used, and general background

## Key Visualizations

- Salary distribution among respondents
- Top programming languages
- Average salary per programming language
- Filters by country, experience level, and other optional parameters

## How to Use

1. Open the `Project.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop
2. Ensure the data path to `Data.xlsx` is correctly set (you may need to update it)
